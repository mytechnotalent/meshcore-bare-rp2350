# Python Standard (encryption-c-rp2350)

Owned Python files under `scripts/` and any future tooling must comply with
strict PEP8, an eight-line executable function-body limit, no blank lines inside
function bodies, and complete NumPy-style docstrings.

## Scope

Comply with all Python files in `scripts/` and all new Python tools. Vendored or
third-party scripts are excluded.

## Rules

- Use four spaces, no tabs, and `snake_case` names.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` module constants and `PascalCase` classes.
- Keep lines within 79 characters.
- Use standard-library imports before third-party imports.
- Use two blank lines between top-level definitions.
- Every module has a module docstring.
- Every function, including private and nested functions, has a NumPy-style
  docstring with purpose, `Parameters`, and `Returns` sections.
- Function executable bodies contain at most eight lines, except cryptographic
  algorithms.
- Function bodies contain no blank lines.
- Never log or hard-code credentials or secrets.

## Verification

Run `python3 -m flake8 <file.py>` when flake8 is available. Also run:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_python_standard.py
```
